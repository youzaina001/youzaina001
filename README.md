üëã Hello! I'm Yassine, a Data Engineer with proven experience in designing robust data pipelines and industrializing machine learning models, notably at re:mind (start-up). I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights and building intelligent, scalable systems for real-world applications. My work has included processing tens of gigabytes of data daily and significantly improving data access times (e.g., by 40% in a SaaS environment). I am skilled in cloud architecture across GCP, AWS, and Azure, and the automation of ETL workflows.

I'm actively seeking new opportunities in Data & AI where I can leverage my expertise to drive innovation and business value.
